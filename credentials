# WARNING: To avoid accidental leakage of your credentials,

# NOTE: We have this project setup to select the AWS profile via the 
# Spring Active Profile.
#
# So, instead of setting both the SPRING_ACTIVE_PROFILE=stg and AWS_PROFILE=stg
# you only need to do the first.
#
# To learn more about AWS_PROFILE see:
